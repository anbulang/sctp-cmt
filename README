This is the code base for Chang Xiangzhong@UiO master thesis. The task is to
implement the Concurrent Multipath Transfer(CMT) feature of SCTP. The expected
algorithms include (but not limited to)
	1) Split Fast Retransmit (SFR)
	2) Cwnd  Update for CMT (CWC)
	3) Delayed Ack for CMT (DAC)

Tools for tuning and testing
================================================================
1. gnuplot - to draw graphs of cwnd's increment/decrement and ssthresh's. 
	a) File ${KERN_DIR}/sctp_tools/all.sh is the bash script to draw the 
	cwnd and ssthresh informations from the kernel log.
	b) Gnuplot script ${KERN_DIR}/sctp_tools/draw.pl is used to draw
	graphs.

2. tc - traffic control filter of Linux, which is used to shape the traffic
and emulate different test cases.
	a) File ${KERN_DIR}/sctp_tools/set_nic.sh is a wrapper of tc

3. libsctp1 - a library to access SCTP system calls. The following files
implments a very basic server/client model to examine CMT functionality. 
	a) File ${KERN_DIR}/sctp_tools/sender.c
	b) File ${KERN_DIR}/sctp_tools/receiver.c
